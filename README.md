# Taskering

## Description

Taskering is an intuitive tool designed for managing tasks seamlessly within your development environment. It is powered by GoLang and integrates with the Google Tasks API, offering a slick Text-based User Interface (TUI) thanks to the Bubble Tea TUI framework.

With Taskering, you can directly interact with tasks created in Google Calendar. This utility allows you to insert new tasks, delete existing ones, and mark them as complete with ease. 

This project was crafted out of a personal need to track small, everyday tasks while simultaneously working on bigger projects. The integration with `nvim` as an IDE ensures that developers can switch between coding and task management without disrupting their workflow.

## Features

- **Google Calendar Integration**: Directly manipulate your Google Calendar tasks within your IDE.
- **Task Management**: Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete with simple commands.
- **nvim Compatibility**: Designed to work within the `nvim` environment for a fluid developer experience.
